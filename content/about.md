# What is RedSkull?

RedSkull is a Sentinel management service. It provides a means to view, manage,
and monitor your Sentinel+Redis setups.

It began with writing a Command Line Tool for managing a Redis Sentinel, then
morphed into an HTTP+JSON API. At this point I was reminded how much I dislike
developing such an API with curl and decided to write a Web based UI,
converting the API to use the same calls but render JSON instead. Thus, Red
Skull was born.


# Why "Red Skull"?

It is an "inside joke". No, I can't share the joke ... yet.
